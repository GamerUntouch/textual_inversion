# Running Textual Inversion on RunPod using JuptyrLab.
## Notes
```
This should work with any rented GPU with 24GB of VRAM or more.
Remember to navigate to the /workspace/ folder in the directory before starting up a terminal.
You may need to reload the environment if you disconnect.
This SHOULD work with other cloud hosting services that use JuptyrLab.
Images are squished down to 512x512, NOT CROPPED. Cropping them yourself will help with results.
The font in the /data/ file is to fix a problem with the image generation on the trainer.
```


## Setup
### STEP 1
Start a terminal. Then,
```
conda init bash
```
Close off of the terminal. This is to fix a bug with JuptyrLab, this lets you use environments.

### STEP 2
Start another terminal. Then,
```
git clone https://github.com/gameruntouch/textual_inversion

cd textual_inversion
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate ldm

mkdir -p training_data
mkdir -p models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1
wget -O models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/model.ckpt <A link to the SD v1.4 weights, I used dropbox personally.>
```

### STEP 3
Add the image files you would like to train on to the /training_data/ folder. Then,
```
rm training_data/.ipynb_checkpoints/*
rmdir training_data/.ipynb_checkpoints
```
The following script deletes invisible checkpoints that JupytrLab likes to create in the /training_data/ folder which crashes training.


### Commands
Training,
```
cd textual_inversion
conda activate ldm
python main.py --base configs/stable-diffusion/v1-finetune.yaml -t --actual_resume models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/model.ckpt --gpus 0, --data_root training_data --init_word "<TOKEN TO USE AS BASE>" --datadir_in_name false --placeholder_tokens "<WORD USED IN PROMPTS>"
```

Generation,
```
cd textual_inversion
conda activate ldm
python scripts/stable_txt2img.py --ddim_eta 0.0 --n_samples 1 --n_iter 1  --scale 8.0  --ddim_steps 50 --embedding_path <EMBEDDINGS FILE> --ckpt models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/model.ckpt --prompt "<A PROMPT. The placeholder word REQUIRES * before it in the prompt.>"
```

Enjoy. The script is pretty finnicky, but it does work, may need a lot of data for training.

>**Abstract**: <br>
> Text-to-image models offer unprecedented freedom to guide creation through natural language.
  Yet, it is unclear how such freedom can be exercised to generate images of specific unique concepts, modify their appearance, or compose them in new roles and novel scenes.
  In other words, we ask: how can we use language-guided models to turn <i>our</i> cat into a painting, or imagine a new product based on <i>our</i> favorite toy?
  Here we present a simple approach that allows such creative freedom.
  Using only 3-5 images of a user-provided concept, like an object or a style, we learn to represent it through new "words" in the embedding space of a frozen text-to-image model.
  These "words" can be composed into natural language sentences, guiding <i>personalized</i> creation in an intuitive way.
  Notably, we find evidence that a <i>single</i> word embedding is sufficient for capturing unique and varied concepts.
  We compare our approach to a wide range of baselines, and demonstrate that it can more faithfully portray the concepts across a range of applications and tasks.

## Description
This repo contains the official code, data and sample inversions for our Textual Inversion paper. 

## Updates
**21/08/2022 (C)** Code released!

## TODO:
- [x] Release code!
- [x] Optimize gradient storing / checkpointing. Memory requirements, training times reduced by ~55%
- [ ] Release data sets
- [ ] Release pre-trained embeddings
- [ ] Add Stable Diffusion support

## Setup

Our code builds on, and shares requirements with [Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion). To set up their environment, please run:

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate ldm
```

You will also need the official LDM text-to-image checkpoint, available through the [LDM project page](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion). 

Currently, the model can be downloaded by running:

```
mkdir -p models/ldm/text2img-large/
wget -O models/ldm/text2img-large/model.ckpt https://ommer-lab.com/files/latent-diffusion/nitro/txt2img-f8-large/model.ckpt
```

## Usage

### Inversion

To invert an image set, run:

```
python main.py --base configs/latent-diffusion/txt2img-1p4B-finetune.yaml 
               -t 
               --actual_resume /path/to/pretrained/model.ckpt 
               -n <run_name> 
               --gpus 0, 
               --data_root /path/to/directory/with/images
               --init_word <initialization_word>
```

where the initialization word should be a single-token rough description of the object (e.g., 'toy', 'painting', 'sculpture'). If the input is comprised of more than a single token, you will be prompted to replace it.

In the paper, we use 5k training iterations. However, some concepts (particularly styles) can converge much faster.

To run on multiple GPUs, provide a comma-delimited list of GPU indices to the --gpus argument (e.g., ``--gpus 0,3,7,8``)

Embeddings and output images will be saved in the log directory.

See `configs/latent-diffusion/txt2img-1p4B-finetune.yaml` for more options, such as changing the placeholder string which denotes the concept (defaults to "*")

**Important** All training set images should be upright. If you are using phone captured images, check the inputs_gs*.jpg files in the output image directory and make sure they are oriented correctly. Many phones capture images with a 90 degree rotation and denote this in the image metadata. Windows parses these correctly, but PIL does not. Hence you will need to correct them manually (e.g. by pasting them into paint and re-saving) or wait until we add metadata parsing.

### Generation

To generate new images of the learned concept, run:
```
python scripts/txt2img.py --ddim_eta 0.0 
                          --n_samples 8 
                          --n_iter 2 
                          --scale 10.0 
                          --ddim_steps 50 
                          --embedding_path /path/to/logs/trained_model/checkpoints/embeddings_gs-5049.pt 
                          --ckpt_path /path/to/pretrained/model.ckpt 
                          --prompt "a photo of *"
```

where * is the placeholder string used during inversion.

### Merging Checkpoints

LDM embedding checkpoints can be merged into a single file by running:

```
python merge_embeddings.py 
--manager_ckpts /path/to/first/embedding.pt /path/to/second/embedding.pt [...]
--output_path /path/to/output/embedding.pt
```

If the checkpoints contain conflicting placeholder strings, you will be prompted to select new placeholders. The merged checkpoint can later be used to prompt multiple concepts at once ("A photo of * in the style of @").

### Pretrained Models / Data
Coming soon

## Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion support is a work in progress and will be completed soonâ„¢.

## Tips and Tricks
- Adding "a photo of" to the prompt usually results in better target consistency.
- Results can be seed sensititve. If you're unsatisfied with the model, try re-inverting with a new seed (by adding `--seed <#>` to the prompt).
